Postgres-R has been initiated in the context of the DRAGON project at
ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. Bettina Kemme and Gustavo Alonso wrote the famous
paper "Don't be lazy, be consistent", which they published in september 2000
at the International Conference on Very Large Databases in Cairo, Egypt.
It proves it is possible to circumvent high deadlock rates and poor response
times even in syncronous, multi-master replication systems. They found the
perfect basis for their work in Postgres, version 6.4.2 at that time.

The main contributors of this prove of concept were: 

		Win Bausch  (bausch@inf.ethz.ch)
		Michael Baumer (baumer@inf.ethz.ch)
		Ignaz Bachmann
		Bettina Kemme (kemme@cs.mcgill.ca))


Around may 2001 Darren Johnson (darren@up.hrcoxmail.com) and others have
started to integrate Postgres-R into Postgres version 7.2. They concentrated
on master-slave replication with failover support. Unfortunately that
project got stuck and did not keep up with the development of Postgres.


Since 2002 Markus Wanner has been working on Postgres-R. He concentrated
on multi-master replication again and based his work on both previous
projects. In July 2006 he presented his work at the 10th Anniversary
Summit of Postgres in Toronto. In July 2008 he released the source code
to the public.


The Postgres Clustering Meeting in Tokyo, 2009 gave further inspiration and
lead to the decision to split the existing Postgres-R patch into several sub-
projects to ease review and maybe allow others to benefit from the work done
for Postgres-R.
